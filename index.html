        <h1>SITUATION UPDATE â€“ July 7, 2022</h1>
        <p>After a devastating flood in early June that affected around 4 million residents, the same area was hit again with record-breaking rainfall that began on June 15. Most of the Sylhet city has gone underwater again, with water continuing to rise, worsening the condition of those still living in temporary shelters and further exposed to extreme weather and waterborne diseases. 
        Up to this date, the flood has affected nearly 7 millions people throughout Bangladesh-worst-flood-hit areas. Most of the affected communities are the ones that are already living in very poor conditions and low economy households. </p>
